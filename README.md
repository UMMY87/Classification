# Classification
This code snippet showcases two different plots representing data distribution and classification boundaries. In the first plot, a single-variable dataset is visualized, where points with `y=1` are marked with red crosses, and points with `y=0` are marked with blue circles. The plot provides a clear depiction of the classification boundary between the two classes. 

The second plot displays a two-variable dataset along with its classification boundaries. The data points are plotted with different markers and colors based on their corresponding class labels. Additionally, the plot illustrates the decision boundary separating the two classes, providing insights into the model's performance in distinguishing between the classes. 

The `plt_one_addpt_onclick` function allows users to interactively add new data points to the plot by clicking on the figure. This functionality facilitates the exploration of how the decision boundary evolves with the addition of new data points, providing a dynamic visualization of the classification process. Overall, these visualizations aid in understanding the behavior of classification algorithms and the effectiveness of their learned decision boundaries in separating different classes.
